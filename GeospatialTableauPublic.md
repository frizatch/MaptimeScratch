# Tableau Public: Making quick data visualizations

![](imagesTableau/TableauLogo.jpeg)

## What is Tableau?
Tableau is a tool meant for turning cleaned data quickly into interactive visualizations

Tableau Public is free, but data is openly saved on the web. Free academic licenses are granted for Tableau Desktop which allows saving workbooks locally, but the free license is only for teaching, not research. Tableau Prep is another pay-for software that is aptly named - it's for prepping data for analysis in Tableau Desktop.



## This introductory exercise will address:

- Tableau's automatic data classifications
- Working with spreadsheet data (Excel)
- Working with geospatial data and background maps
- Investigating other data source files
