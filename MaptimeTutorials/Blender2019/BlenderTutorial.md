# Blender: Making topograpich relief beautiful

![](images/Blender_____.png)

## What are we doing?
Blender is a high powered, opensource 3D animation software that we can use for rendering digital elevation models for amazing relief cartography and scene building. The UI for Blender is overwhelming (SO MANY THINGS!), but step through this tutorial to find the bits you need for topographic rendering.


## This exercise follows an excellent and more detailed tutorial by Daniel Huffman, but I've pulled out the skeleton of his workflow and updated the visuals with the 2.8 release UI and and nuances. For more in-depth discussion of what we're doing, please see his tutorial for 2.79 (He'll be updating for 2.8 soon!).

What we'll do:

- Tableau's automatic data classifications
- Working with spreadsheet data (Excel)
- Working with geospatial data and background maps
- Final product: a project in Blender that will let us easily create a hillshade for any DEM we want!

## Set up

**Downloading**

* [Blender download](https://www.blender.org/)

Get 2.8! This new, and very different version has a much slicker interface and many of the odd hangups from previous releases have been happily tweaked.
